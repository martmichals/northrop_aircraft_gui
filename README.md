# REconnaisance Aircraft GUI
Author: Martin Michalski<br/>
In active development: 8/2018 - 5/2019<br/><br/>

A GUI written to display flight telemetry for a UAV built as part of Northrop Grumman's HIP Program. Makes use of Google's Static Maps API.
To run, needs a flight history file, with one provided in the repository as a sample. Currently, there is no support for 
the reading of live flight data. To see a video of drone flight side-by-side with this software, click

<br/><br/><h2>To Run:</h2>
1. Download all files in repository <br/>
2. Replace "MAPS_API_KEY" in GPSTrackingMap.java with your Google Static Maps API key <br/>
3. Run
